Streamix is a library for reactive programming designed to handle asynchronous data flows with clarity and performance.

Streamix is built for developers who want a simple, efficient way to manage asynchronous data streams, with minimal overhead and maximum flexibility. It supports a wide range of operators and powerful features for dealing with complex computational tasks, such as Web Workers, all while maintaining a lightweight footprint.

Streamix offers a simple, effective way to handle asynchronous data streams without the overhead of more advanced libraries like RxJS, while still maintaining robust features for dealing with async patterns.

## Key Concepts
- Stream: A sequence of values that can be observed. Streams can emit values either synchronously or asynchronously.
- Emission: The individual values emitted by a stream, along with metadata like whether the emission was canceled or if it encountered an error.
- Operator: Functions that transform, filter, or combine streams of data.
- Pipeline: A pipeline is a series of stream operators chained together to process data.
- Bus: An event bus to manage and coordinate stream emissions, simplifying complex interactions between multiple streams.

## Why Streamix?
Streamix is designed for those who need a straightforward way to manage asynchronous data without the complexity of larger frameworks. It's a great alternative to RxJS for simpler use cases, offering all the core functionality you need in a more lightweight, efficient package.
