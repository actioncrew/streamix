## Why Streamix?

Streamix is designed for developers who need a **simple, lightweight solution** for managing asynchronous data streams. It provides many of the core features of RxJS but with a **minimalistic approach**, making it ideal for:

- Modern web applications.
- Performance-critical tasks.
- Projects where simplicity and small bundle size are priorities.

---

## Key Features

- **Lightweight**: With a bundle size of approximately 5 KB (zipped), Streamix is optimized for performance and efficiency.
- **Familiar API**: If you're already familiar with RxJS, you'll find Streamix easy to pick up, as it supports many core RxJS operators.
- **Unique Tools**: Streamix includes specialized tools for handling heavy computational tasks, making it suitable for performance-oriented applications.
- **Asynchronous Support**: It simplifies asynchronous programming, allowing you to manage user interactions, network requests, and UI updates seamlessly.
- **Streams and Emissions**: Streamix introduces a simplified concept of streams (represented as async generator functions) and emissions, making it easier to work with asynchronous data flows.
---

## Core Concepts

- **Stream**: A sequence of values over time, represented as an async generator function.
- **Emission**: Individual values emitted by a stream, along with metadata (e.g., cancellation, errors).
- **Operator**: Functions that transform, filter, or combine streams.
- **Subject**: A special type of stream that allows manual dispatching of emissions.

## Installation

Install Streamix via npm:

```bash
npm install @actioncrew/streamix
```
---

## Usage Example
Here's an example of using Streamix to compute and render a Mandelbrot set on an HTML canvas:
```typescript
import { compute, concatMap, coroutine, debounce, finalize, map, mergeMap, onResize, range, scan, startWith, Stream, tap } from '@actioncrew/streamix';

const task = coroutine(computeMandelbrotInChunks, computeMandelbrot, computeColor);
this.canvas = document.getElementById('mandelbrotCanvas')! as HTMLCanvasElement;

const subscription = onResize(this.canvas).pipe(
  startWith({ width: window.innerWidth, height: window.innerHeight }),
  tap(({width, height}) => {
    this.showProgressOverlay();
    this.canvas.width = width;
    this.canvas.height = height;

    this.ctx = this.canvas.getContext('2d')!;
    this.ctx.clearRect(0, 0, width, height);
  }),
  debounce(100),
  concatMap(({width, height}: any) => {
    const imageData = this.ctx.createImageData(width, height);
    const data = imageData.data;

    return range(0, width * height, 1000).pipe(
      map(index => ({ index, width, height, maxIterations: 20, zoom: 200,
                      centerX: width / 2, centerY: height / 2,
                      panX: 0.5, panY: 0 })),
      mergeMap((params) => compute(task, params)),
      tap((result: any) => {
        result.forEach(({ px, py, r, g, b }: any) => {
          const i = py * width + px;
          const index = i * 4;
          data[index] = r;
          data[index + 1] = g;
          data[index + 2] = b;
          data[index + 3] = 255;
        });
      }),
      scan((acc, _, index) => {
        const progress = ((index! + 1) * 1000 / (width * height)) * 100;
        requestAnimationFrame(() => this.updateProgressBar(progress));
        return acc;
      }, 0),
      finalize(() => {
        this.ctx.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);
        this.hideProgressOverlay();
      })
    )}),
    finalize(() => {
      task.finalize();
    })
).subscribe();
```
