/**
 * Creates a stream operator that emits only distinct values from the source stream.
 *
 * This operator maintains an internal set of values or keys that it has already emitted.
 * For each new value from the source, it checks if it has been seen before. If not,
 * the value is emitted and added to the set; otherwise, it is skipped.
 *
 * The uniqueness check can be based on the value itself or on a key derived from
 * the value using a provided `keySelector` function. This makes it ideal for de-duplicating
 * streams of primitive values or complex objects.
 *
 * @template T The type of the values in the source stream.
 * @template K The type of the key used for comparison.
 * @param keySelector An optional function to derive a unique key from each value.
 * If not provided, the values themselves are used for comparison.
 * @returns An `Operator` instance that can be used in a stream's `pipe` method.
